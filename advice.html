  <h1> Advice Begins </h1>
  <p><h1> Take advantage of all volunteer opportunities within your community and school. Also when searching for volunteer opportunities try to volunteer at a certain organization for a good amount of time because colleges tend to see how committed you actually are.</p></h1>
  <p><h1> Always seek help whenever you are struggling in a certain subject don't hesitate to ask any questions because it is better to know and understand than not understand at all. </p></h1>
  <p><h1> Do not procrastinate! (I know you have probably heard this a million times but it is true!!) </p></h1>
  <p><h1> Down below is a comment section in where you can input your own advice and experience :) </p></h1>

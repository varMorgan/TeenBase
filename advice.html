  <h4> Advice Begins </h4>
  <p> Take advantage of all volunteer opportunities within your community and school. Also when searching for volunteer opportunities try to volunteer at a certain organization for a good amount of time becaus colleges tend to see how committed you actually are.</p>
  <p> Always seek help whenever you are struggling in a certain subject don't hesitate to ask any questions because it is better to know and understand than not understand at all. </p>
  <p> Do not procrastinate! (I know you have probably heard this a million times but it is true!!) </p>
  <p> Down below is a comment section in where you can input your own advice and experience :) </p>

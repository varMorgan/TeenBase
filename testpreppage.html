    <h2>Unfortunately, test taking becomes more and more prevalent during your highschool years.
       Everyone approaches test taking differently, but we want to share some of the
       resources and tips that were most helpful for us.</h2>
    <h2>Good Luck, -Admin MASTER Morgan :) </h2>

      <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse/playlists" class="links">Crash Course Series</a>: I found this resource very helpful when I took the AP World
      History exam. The information is quickly introduced and there are visuals. -Admin Morgan</h2>

      <h2><a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college/ap-test-prep" class="links">The Princeton Review Books</a>: I have only taken the AP World and AP Human
        Geo tests, but these books were very helpful. They have practice test and quick reviews over each unit.
        Also, if you do not want to buy a new one, ask around school and, more often than not, someone else will have on from a previous year.
        You could also check half priced books. They are just as helpful. -Admin Morgan</h2>

      <h2>"AP Tests take place at the end of AP classes, and theyâ€™re used as a means of assessing how much you learned in the class and whether your experience merits college credit.
        You can also prepare for AP Tests independently outside of the course if you don't feel totally comfortable with the material after going over it in class."</h2>

        a lot of different subjects, but they also have SAT and AP prep. -GWC Girls</h2>
